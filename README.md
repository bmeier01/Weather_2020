# Introduction
Being out running regularly during lockdown in April and May 2020, I felt this spring was particularly beautiful. To analyse how the 2020 weather compared to previous years or the average for these months, I downloaded data for the local weatherstation from the MetOffice which encompasses weather records since 1957 and created quick visualizations for minimium and maximum temperatures, hours of rain, and hours of sunshine. Initially, I looked at the dataset at the beginning of May and downloaded updated data in June. 

# Results
February 2020 was locally the wettest February since 1977, while April 2020 was dryier than average, similar in rainfall to 2017.
